Yeah, to relax after a long day, I love to play video games, and sometimes I watch Netflix. My favorite video game is Beyond All Reasons. In addition, I like to play Turing Complete game. This is a game about computing and about bit operations and about logic. In Netflix, I like to see series Pluto. It's a new series. The series is a cyberpunk story about robots that live with humans. It's very interesting, I think. It looks like some kind of Blade Runner and great atmosphere. I watched only first episodes yet, and I hope it will be interesting in the future. Thank you for watching.
