That sounds like a great way to unwind! What's your favorite video game to play, and do you have any favorite shows or movies on Netflix that you enjoy watching? "Beyond All Reasons" and "Turing Complete" both sound interesting, especially if you enjoy logic and computing. And "Pluto" on Netflix seems like a series worth watching. What do you find most appealing about the series "Pluto"? That sounds intriguing!
